  Apply a filter to an image. Return the filtered image.

  - image: numpy nd-array of dim (m, n, c)
  - filter: numpy nd-array of dim (k, k)
  Returns
  - filtered_image: numpy nd-array of dim (m, n, c)

  HINTS:
  - You may not use any libraries that do the work for you. Using numpy to work
   with matrices is fine and encouraged. Using opencv or similar to do the
   filtering for you is not allowed.
  - I encourage you to try implementing this naively first, just be aware that
   it may take an absurdly long time to run. You will need to get a function
   that takes a reasonable amount of time to run so that the TAs can verify
   your code works.
  - Remember these are RGB images, accounting for the final image dimension.
